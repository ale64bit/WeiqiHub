name: Community CI (No Private Dependencies)

# This workflow provides essential validation for pull requests and pushes,
# including those from external contributors. It runs:
#   - Static code analysis (flutter analyze)
#   - Unit tests (flutter test)
#
# What it DOESN'T run:
#   - Cross-platform builds (Linux/macOS/Windows)
#   - Production builds with private game clients (FoxWQ, Tygem)
#   - Builds requiring private submodules or tokens
#
# This ensures fast feedback for contributors while keeping the essential
# quality checks that catch most issues.
